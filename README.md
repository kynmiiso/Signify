Signify is an innovative app that allows us to bridge the communication gap faced by the hard of hearing every day. Signify uses Machine Learning and Computer Vision to detect ASL signs, allowing us to close the communication gap through translation between ASL gestures and spoken languages, as well as a learning platform to practice ASL. 

**Learn**
Signify allows users to learn American Sign Language (ASL) through a gamified learning platform. A flashcard of a word from the Sign Dictionary is displayed on-screen and the user must make the sign correctly in a limited amount of time to win.
